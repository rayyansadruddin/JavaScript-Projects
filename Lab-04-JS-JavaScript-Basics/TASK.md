Create a simple javascript program (in ```script.js```) that does the following:

- Set a number using `let num = __` 
- Process that information in some way (math)
- Use `console.log()` to display the results (with an appropriate String/text message)

Do this several times (at least 5), using different math operations each time.


In your program be sure to:
 
- Include a Header
- Include descriptive comments (one comment for each **P**rocess/**O**utput is sufficient)
- Descriptive variable names in camelCase
